Design and Simulation of combinational logic circuit based on MATLAB
Abstract
A kind of
MATLAB is a powerful mathematical software, which has been widely used in many fields. In this paper, the introduction
Based on the principle of combinational logic circuit, the simulation is carried out with SIMULINK in MATLAB. Because the output signal of combinational logic circuit only depends on the input signal at that time, this paper uses SINULINK logic modules to complete the construction of circuit diagram, and through the input signal, observes whether the output signal conforms to the logic function, and further verifies the correctness of the circuit. A kind of
The simulation results show that the design and debugging of the combined circuit by using MATLAB are intuitive, time-saving and labor-saving. It can not only be used to simulate the circuits mentioned in this paper, but also be widely used in the simulation of other logic circuits. It is an effective tool for the design and debugging of logic circuits.
